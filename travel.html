	<h3 style="color:maroon;">Reimbursment</h3><p style="color:black;"><font size="+2">

If we've offered you travel support, please bring your receipts with you to the summer school. Receipts must include proof of purchase (so, for instance, boarding passes or confirmation e-mails that do not include proof of payment are not needed). During the week we will provide reimbursement forms for you to complete to begin the travel reimbursement process.

In addition, if your travel is being supported by us, please book your flights using a US airline if possible, since this is simpler for us to reimburse. Don't worry if you've already booked flights using a non-US airline, we will still be able to provide your reimbursement.
