									<p style="color:black;" align="left"><font size="+2">The <a href="https://www.math.umass.edu">Department of Mathematics and Statistics</a> at the University of Massachusetts Amherst 
									will host its third annual summer school on Physical Mathematics of Quantum Field Theory during the week of <strong> June 10 - 14, 2024</strong>.
 									The aim of the workshop is to introduce young researchers on the boundary between mathematics and physics to recent ideas in classical and quantum 
									field theory using notions from complex geometry and algebraic topology. The target audience of the workshop is advanced graduate students and post-docs,
									from both mathematics and theoretical physics. The schedule will be designed to include a large amount of time for participants to interact. We hope 
										especially to encourage conversations between mathematicians and physicists. </p>

 <p style="color:black;">
The conference events will begin with breakfast (coffee, tea, pastries and bagels) from 9:00am on Monday June 10th, with the first talk starting around 9:30am.  We will meet in Marcus Hall, Room 131. You may refer to the following <a href="https://my.umass.edu/on_campus/campusmap/index">campus map</a> for the location.   The last talk will end on Friday June 14th at 12pm.
Wi-Fi: Attached is a handout with instructions to login to wifi, including guest ID and password.<br/> 
									<br/> 
<h4 style="color:maroon;"> Parking</h4>
	Participants staying in the conference accommodation will have parking passes provided upon check in for surface Lot 44 (reference the <a href="https://maps.umass.edu/parking/#?latitude=42.39030&longitude=-72.52930&zoom=-1.0&rotation=0&basemap=topo-vector">parking map</a> for the location). If participants staying in the accommodation would like to pull up closer to the dorm to unload their belongings, they may do so with their hazard lights on and then move their cars to the designated lot afterwards.  Participants not staying in the accommodation may park in the Campus Center Parking Garage.  If you would like a parking pass for free parking in the garage, please e-mail the organizers by May 31st to request one.

	<h4 style="color:maroon;">Meals</h4> 
Food is available on campus at the Blue Wall food court and at the Worcester dining commons.  You can find the most up to date dining common and retail dining availability <a href="https://umassdining.com/locations-menus">here</a>.  There are also a variety of restaurants available in downtown Amherst, a 20 minute walk or 5 minute bus ride from campus.  On Sunday 6/9 most on campus dining will be closed, but food will be available to purchase at Harvest Market in the campus center from 8am to 9pm.
There will coffee and tea available for all the talk periods, and pastries and bagels will be served in the morning from 9am each day.  <br/> 
<br/> 
	 <h4 style="color:maroon;">Information for participants staying in on-campus accommodation</h4> 
Check-in will take place in the North C Apartment building starting at 11AM on Sunday 6/9. Each participant will receive their rooming information, an access card to get into the building and their apartment, as well as a physical key to their individual room.  Check out time is by 2pm on Saturday 6/15 at the latest.
While bathrooms are stocked with toilet paper, participants should plan to bring hand soap as well as any other personal necessities.  There is a CVS within a walk or bus ride from campus at which you can purchase any essentials that you need, located at 76 N Pleasant Street. Linen packets will be provided and include 2 sheets, 1 pillow with case, a blanket and 2 towels. While apartments include a kitchen this does not include cookware, cutlery, and plates.
There are coin operated laundry facilities in each building however we recommend using a guest card to avoid running into issues. Guest cards can be purchased for $1 at transfer stations (one located in Campus Center near Harvest Market entrance) and load money onto the card to be used multiple times. These cards can also be used for printing materials from the library. Learn more here.
24/7 SCH Staff Available: There are conference housing staff members working 24/7 during the summer. The main number to reach them at is 413-687-1230 and can be used for any housing related needs that might arise during your stay. Please use this number if there are any lockouts, if you run out of TP or have any general issues or maintenance needs.<br/>
