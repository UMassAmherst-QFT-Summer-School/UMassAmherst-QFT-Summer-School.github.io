Physical Mathematics of Quantum Field Theory

The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst will host a summer school on Physical Mathematics of Quantum Field Theory during the week August 1st to 5th, 2022. 

The aim of the workshop is to introduce young researchers on the boundary between mathematics and physics to recent ideas in classical and quantum field theory using notions from complex geometry and algebraic topology. The target audience of the workshop is advanced graduate students and post-docs, from both mathematics and theoretical physics. The schedule will be designed to include a large amount of time for participants to interact. We hope especially to encourage conversations between mathematicians and physicists. 

All talks will be held in the following location:
Integrative Learning Center, Room S131
You can find a UMass Amherst campus map here. 

There will be series of lectures given by: 
Ron Donagi, University of Pennsylvania - Supermoduli
Angela Gibney, University of Pennsylvania - On Vector Bundles of Conformal Blocks on the Moduli Space of Curves from Representations of Vertex Operator Algebras
Lecture 1: Introduction to the week and moduli of curves
Lecture 2: Vertex operator algebras
Lecture 3: Sheaves of coinvariants and their properties
Lecture 4: Open problems
Lecture notes are available here.
Natalie Paquette, University of Washington - Twisted Theories and Koszul Duality
Du Pei, University of Southern Denmark and CMSA, Harvard - Invariants of Manifolds from 6d QFTs
